/* 
  This file is intentionally modified to resolve a build error.
  The original line was: /// <reference types="vite/client" />
  It was removed because the TypeScript compiler could not find the specified type definition,
  which is usually due to an environment setup issue. As no code in this project currently
  relies on Vite-specific client types (like import.meta.env), removing it is a safe workaround.
